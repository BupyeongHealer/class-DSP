# Digital Signal Processing Class

-  I was implementing matlab code for various type of filters or functions.

## Development Environment
- IDE : Matlab
- OS : Windows10
- Language : Matlab

## Overview
1. Linearlity Test
2. Sampling
3. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
4. Digital Filter
5. Filter Design

## 1. Linearlity Test

- As I plot the function, I can classify whether linear or not


## 2. Sampling

- Because Our Digital system is discrete, I convert Infinite impulse signal(IIR) to Finite Impulse signal(FIR).

## 3. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

- I learned from the graph that the results of dft and fft are the same, and that in large projects, fft algorithms should be used for the efficiency of computation.

- Even though I tried to register the app on the Play Store, I couldn't because of the copyright of National Team Photo.
