# Digital Signal Processing Class

-  I was implementing matlab code for various type of filters or functions.

## Development Environment
- IDE : Matlab
- OS : Windows10
- Language : Matlab

## Overview
1. Linearlity Test
2. Sampling
3. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
4. Digital Filter
5. Filter Design
  1. Noise Reduction
  2. Speech Reduction
  3. Making Echo using IIR & FIR

## 1. Linearlity Test
<br>

- As I plot the function, I can classify whether linear or not


## 2. Sampling
<br>

- Because Our Digital system is discrete, I convert Infinite impulse signal(IIR) to Finite Impulse signal(FIR).

## 3. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
<br>

- I learned from the graph that the results of dft and fft are the same, and that in large projects, fft algorithms should be used for the efficiency of computation.


## 4. Digital Filter
<br>

- I implemented digital filter on two kinds of functions.

## 5. Filter Design

### Noise Reduction using Lowpass filter & Highpass filter

- I implemented various kinds of filter and window function to reduce noise at simple sound and speech.
- I also implemented echo sound using IIR & FIR on "Legends never die (by Alan walker)" Music.
